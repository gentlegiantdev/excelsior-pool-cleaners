## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SASS

Website for pool cleaning service. This fully-responsive site functions beautifully across devices and is intended to act as a sales pitch for the service. 

## Optimizations

I created this site with the expectation that login functionality might be needed to allow for clients to track and pay for services. The side bar can easily be modified to allow for these options. I am hopeful that will come to fruition.
